1. If you don't have the SDL library installed, run:

            brew install sdl2

2. Use these commands to get the cflags and lib flags for your Makefile:
            sdl2-config --cflags
            sdl2-config --libs
Or just change the intra login to your own in the CFLAGS and LIB section in the Makefile.
3. Run make

4. Run ./minisynth [filename.synth].

5. Enjoy the beautiful Symphony Of Destruction!
